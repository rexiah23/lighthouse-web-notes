### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.


 * Modify the contents of the function below, such that:
 
 * If we're not hungry, we want to tell ourselves to get back to work.
 * Otherwise, we want to pick something up and eat it in the lab when
 * we've got less than 20 minutes or to try a place nearby if we've
 * got between 20 and 30 minutes. If we have any more time than that,
 * we want to remind ourselves that we're in a bootcamp and that we
 * should reconsider how much time we actually have to spare.

 * hungry is a Boolean, representing if you're hungry or not.
 * availableTime is a Number representing the time you have for lunch,
 * in minutes.
 

```javascript const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log("Get back to work!")
  } else {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Get lunch at the lab!")
    } else if (availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log("Get lunch at a restaurant in Gastown!")
    } else {
      console.log("Skip lunch - did you forget you're at a bootcamp?")
    }
  }
}
```



 * This is some test runner code that's simply calling our whatToDoForLunch function
 * defined above to verify we're making the right decisions. Do not modify it!
 

``` javascript console.log("I'm hungry and I have 20 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 20);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 50 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 50);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm not hungry and I have 30 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(false, 30);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 15 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 15);
```
